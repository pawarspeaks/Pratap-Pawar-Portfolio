      "Projects, facilities, services, and gadgets are attracting more people as life speeds up. Blockchain and cryptocurrency systems are trending worldwide. Blockchain interests everyone with technology. They make an interesting transaction medium because they have no single powerful source. Cryptocurrencies are vital financial software platforms. Mining is crucial to its decentralised information ledger dataset. Mining adds transaction data to the chain, a decentralised ledger that lets users securely agree on actions. In 2008, Santoshi Nakamoto tried to use blockchain as a restricted ledger for bitcoin, the most successful cryptocurrency. It's unlike the internet. This chapter will discuss blockchain security, cryptocurrency fraud, cyberattacks, etc. This chapter identifies cryptocurrency blockchain threats and proposes solutions. This chapter reviews and analyses top-cited articles to reach a conclusion. In this chapter, strengths and threats of cryptocurrency and their emergence in the internet-connected financial payments in the futuristic economic world will be discussed.",

    abstract:
      "One of the most fascinating technological components of an ambient intelligence system is its potential to behave independently for the benefit of humans. We used to be able to pinpoint exactly where computers were and how they affected our lives. This has steadily blurred, and now various types of computing devices are all around us, implanted in numerous objects we interact with and thereby influencing our lives. There are signs that this tendency is unstoppable, and that computers and society will now interact in considerably deeper ways than before, to the point where computing will become invisible to people while remaining deeply linked in our daily lives. Looking back on 20 years of educational research, the authors retrieved more than 400 research articles based on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and internet of things (IoT) techniques in teaching and learning.",
